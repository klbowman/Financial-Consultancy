Unsupervised machine learning models to cluster cryptocurrency data.

## Description

This repository is designed to identify clusters in cryptocurrency data using unsupervised machine learning models. Information for each cryptocurrency in the dataset includes the coin's algorithm, trading status, proof type, total coins mined and supplied.


visualize taxonomic data using charts, and display metadata in an organized panel. The [data](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/) comes from a study that sequenced the microbiome of 153 human belly buttons (Hulcr et al., 2012), and is stored in the samples.json file. Individual samples are identified by a numerical code and accompanied by metadata including age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) id numbers and counts are provided for each sample.

The dashboard includes a drop-down menu that displays the numerical code for each individual sample. When a sample is selected, the “Demographic Info” panel is populated with metadata and the following three charts are populated with data:
* Bar graph displaying the top 10 OTUs by count
* Gauge plot showing the belly button scrubs per week
* Bubble plot displaying OTU counts for the entire sample
